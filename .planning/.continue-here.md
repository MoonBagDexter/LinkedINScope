# Continue Here: LinkedInScope v1 Migration

## Current State

**V1 milestone is COMPLETE and AUDITED.**

All 4 phases delivered, all 11 requirements satisfied, milestone audit passed.

You just ran `/gsd:audit-milestone` and it passed with 100% scores across all categories.

## What's Been Done

### Phases Complete
- Phase 1: Foundation & Auth (Phantom wallet, job cards, Quick Apply)
- Phase 2: Engagement Core (click tracking, Kanban board, lane migrations)
- Phase 2.5: Backend Job Caching (Edge Function, Supabase cache, pg_cron)
- Phase 3: Real-Time & Polish (live updates, animations, degen toasts)

### Audit Results
- Requirements: 11/11 (100%)
- Phases: 4/4 verified
- Integration: 23/23 exports wired
- E2E Flows: 4/4 complete
- Report: `.planning/v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`

## What's Remaining

### Immediate Next Step
Complete the milestone (archive planning docs, tag release):
```
/gsd:complete-milestone v1
```

### After Milestone Completion
1. **Deploy to production** (Vercel + Supabase production)
2. **Manual testing** (human verification checklist in audit report)
3. **Optional: Plan v2** with features from REQUIREMENTS.md:
   - Discovery: search, filters, bookmarks
   - Anti-Gaming: rate limits, trust scores
   - More Auth: email/password, Google OAuth

## Tech Debt (Minor)
- 3 deprecated files to clean up (useJobs.ts, jsearch.ts, JobList.tsx)
- Non-blocking, can address in v2

## Key Files
- `.planning/v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` - Full audit report
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` - Phase overview
- `.planning/STATE.md` - Detailed execution history
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` - v1 complete, v2 defined

## Resume Command
```
/gsd:resume-work
```
